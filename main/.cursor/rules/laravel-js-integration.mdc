Laravel JavaScript Integration:
Use @vite('resources/js/modules/filename.js') in Blade templates to include specific modules
Configure vite.config.js to handle multiple entry points for modular JavaScript
Export functions as default or named exports from modules
Import and use functions where needed rather than global scope
